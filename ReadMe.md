# TMDB API key
The API key is not shared. The app would crash without it. (To be handled in stage two)
Use your API key in the below code:

* File - MovieListFragment.java

`private static final String TMDB_API_KEY = "<TMDB API KEY HERE>";`

# Sort order
* Sort order set by passing different parameters in the url - popular.desc, vote_average.desc.
* Can also be done by sorting the same list based on popularity or user ratings.
